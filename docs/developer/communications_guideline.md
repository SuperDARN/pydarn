# Communications Guidelines 

pyDARN is a collaborative community of engineers, scientists, and programmers that is working towards an easy maintainable python library for data visualizations for SuperDARN. 
To achieve the collaborative community, constructive feedback will be given to allow the growth of pyDARN. However, toxic and negative communication will not be tolerated, this includes users as well. 

To ensure a constructive positive environment is met please follow the following guidelines for the following situations: 

## General communication 

1. No negative or discriminate comments 
2. Avoid over talking/ignoring someone's comments - this is a collaborative group, so everyone's thoughts and opinions matter. 
3. No mocking - comments that do not belong in the conversation, or making fun of someone's profession or skills will not be tolerated
4. Stay on topic - discussion can easily change and evolve into other topics, please make sure to stay within scope. If scope creep happens try to relocate that discussion to another *Issue* or discussion point


## Issues 
1. Keep comments sweet and to the point - reading lengthy explanations can be overwhelming and encourage scope creep
2. No scope creeping - If scope creep occurs, make another *Issue* on that topic
3. Take individual discussion offline - If the issue involves a lengthy discussion with a group or two individuals then do it offline from the repository to avoid annoying others with multiple GitHub notifications. If a resolution is made from the discussion then summarize it on the *Issue* so others are aware. 
4. 

## Pull Requests 
1. Its all about the code - keep comments focused on the code and avoid individual comments 
2. Purpose solutions when pointing out problems - code is personal to the developer so pointing out problems can be overwhelming. To help prevent defensive behaviour try to suggest solutions to their problems. 
3. Don't jump to conclusions - code is hard to predict the outcome, so accusing code of being "Dangerous" or breaking the whole project can be taken negatively. Make sure to provide test cases with your conclusions and suggest possible solutions. 
4. There is a reason for every *Pull Request* - Everyone in this community has an expertise in what they do, so their *Pull Request* probably has a good purpose. Be open minded try to accept what they are trying to purpose. If it doesn't work with the current architecture but the idea is good, then suggest another strategy. 
5. 

### Code Reviews 
#### Reviewer 
#### Developer

#### Extra resources 

## What if someone is not following these guidelines? 

Due to the nature of pyDARN not falling under any working group jurisdiction, it is left to the senior developers of pyDARN to contact the person who is not following guidelines. 
pyDARN uses a three strike policy unless the person presents a toxic behaviour then they will be immediately removed. 
Three strike policy: 
1. Warning will be issued and the senior developer will ask the person to review this guideline again 
2. Another warning will be issued but informing the person they will be removed if no change is made
3. Removal from the group
