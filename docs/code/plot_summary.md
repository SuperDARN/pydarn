# Summary Plot 

Summary plot combines the pyDARN *RTP* method `plot_range_time` and 
`plot_time_series` to generate a standard SuperDARN Summary plot. These 
plots may also be known as Range-Time Intesity (RTI) plots. This figure
comprises of seven plots:

| Plot Type | Fields plotted | Description |
-----------------------------------------
| time-series | `noise.search` and `noise.sky` | *Search Noise* and *Sky Noise* |
| time-series | `tfreq` and `navee`| *Frequency ($MHz$)* and *Number of Averages* |
