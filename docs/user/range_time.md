# Range-Time Parameter Plots 
---

Range-time parameter plots (also known as range-time intensity (RTI) plots) plot a vector parameter alone range gates versus time. 

!!! Note
    Slant ranges are future enhancement we are currently working on. Sorry for inconvenience.



### Examples 

#### Plotting with a custom color map and/or normalization 

Normally cmap is provided as a string to `RTP.plot_range_time(fitacf_data, cmap='jet')`, however, this defaults background and groundscatter to white and grey. 
A user can change the background color using the `background` and `groundscatter` option by:

```python
```
