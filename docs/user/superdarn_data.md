# Getting SuperDARN Data 

pyDARN does not provide an interface to downloading data. However, there are other means of getting access to the data. 

The Data Distribution Working Group (DDWG) manages the checking and distribution of data if you have any inquiries, please contact the chair Kevin Krieger at superdarn@usask.ca

## Data Mirrors
To get access to the data, there are two data servers setup: 

  - [SuperDARN Canada](https://superdarn.ca/): uses [Globus](https://github.com/SuperDARNCanada/globus) to allow access to the SuperDARN data. 
  - [BAS](https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/superdarn/#about): information on data access can be found [here](https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/superdarn/#about)

## Citing Data

Please cite SuperDARN appropriately and/or pyDARN if used in any scientific publications. More information can be found here.
