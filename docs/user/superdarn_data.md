# Getting SuperDARN Data 

pyDARN does not provide an interface for downloading data. However, there are other means of getting access to the data. 

The [Data Distribution Working Group (DDWG)](https://github.com/SuperDARN/DDWG) manages the checking and distribution of data. If you have any inquiries, please contact the chair or submit an [issue on DDWG repo](https://github.com/SuperDARN/DDWG/issues)


## Data Mirrors
To get access to rawacf, fitacf and sometimes higher lever data, there are three possible data servers: one utilizes *Globus*, others use `rsync`, `sftp` and `scp`:

  - [SuperDARN Canada](https://superdarn.ca/): uses [Globus](https://github.com/SuperDARNCanada/globus) to allow access to the SuperDARN data. 
  - [BAS](https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/superdarn/#about): information on data access can be found [here](https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/superdarn/#data)
  - [NSSC](https://www.nssdc.ac.cn/nssdc_en/html/task/sdarn.html): please contact NSSC for access.


## RAWACF Data
Raw data with DOI's can be accessed on [FRDR](https://www.frdr-dfdr.ca/repo/collection/superdarn).
These data are published once all gaps are checked and PIs are happy with the collection for each year and no data is under embargo. This process can take up to two years, recent rawacf data can be supplied by the mirrors above.
