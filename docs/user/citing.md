# How to cite SuperDARN

Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) is a network of 36 radars 20 institutions, to cite general SuperDARN you can use: Greenwald, R.A., Baker, K.B., Dudeney, J.R. et al. Space Sci Rev (1995) 71: 761. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00751350
for most recent achievement you can cite either for overall SuperDARN or mid-latitude radars: 
  - Chisham, G., Lester, M., Milan, S.E. et al. A decade of the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN): scientific achievements, new techniques and future directions. Surv Geophys 28, 33â€“109 (2007) doi:10.1007/s10712-007-9017-8
  - Nishitani, N., Ruohoniemi, J.M., Lester, M. et al. Review of the accomplishments of mid-latitude Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) HF radars. Prog Earth Planet Sci 6, 27 (2019) doi:10.1186/s40645-019-0270-5

When using data from only a couple institutions please contact the Principal Investigator (PI) of that radar as it is common curtsy to include them as a co-author of the publication. 
A list of radars, institutions and their PI's information can be found [here](http://vt.superdarn.org/tiki-index.php?page=Radar+Overview).
