# Accessing Hardware File Information 

SuperDARN Radar hardware information is stored in hardware files located [here](https://github.com/vtsuperdarn/hdw.dat). 
pyDarn pulls down the hardware files from the `master` branch on the [repository](https://github.com/vtsuperdarn/hdw.dat) to obtain geographical and hardware information for plotting functionality. 

Users can also read and access these hardware files information by using the function `read_hdw_file`.
``` python 
import pydarn

# Read Saskatoon's hardware file
hdw_data = pydarn.read_hdw_file('sas')
print(hdw_data.geographic)
```
expected output: 
``` python 
_Coord(lat=52.16, lon=-106.53, alt=494.0)
```

A user also has the ability to pull down hardware information for a specific date:
```
import pydarn
from datetime import datetime

# Read Goose Bay radars hardware file for 2003 03 20
hdw_data = pydarn.read_hdw_file('gbr', datetime(2003 3, 20))
print(hdw_data.gates)
```

expected output: 
``` python
75
```

Other information a user can access from the `_HdwInfo` object is:

# Accessing Radar and Hardware Information

Another way to access this information and the radar's full name, institution's name and hemisphere it is in from the station id number (`stid` field in most files) by using `SuperDARNRadars` class. 
This class contains a dictionary of all currently accepted SuperDARN radars (including decommissioned):
``` python
import pydarn

# Access Prince Georges Radar information
radar_info = pydarn.SuperDARNRadars.radars[6]
print(radar_info)
```

Expected output:
```python
_Radar(name='Prince George', institution='University of Saskatchewan', hemisphere=<Hemisphere.North: 1>, hardware_info=_HdwInfo(stid=6, abbrev='pgr', geographic=_Coord(lat=53.98, lon=-122.59, alt=670.0), boresight=-5.0, beam_seperation=3.24, velocity_sign=1.0, rx_attenuator=10.0, tdiff=0.0, phase_sign=1.0, interferometer_offset=_InterferometerOffset(x=0.0, y=-100.0, z=0.0), rx_rise_time=0.0, attenuation_stages=0.0, gates=225, beams=16))
```

!!! Warning
    The hardware information obtained via this class contains most recent updates to the hardware file as it does not take a specific date in. To get specific hardware information, please use `read_hdw_file`.
