# Fan plots
---

Fan plots are a way to visualise data from the entire scan of a SuperDARN radar. 

All beams and ranges for a given parameter (such as line-of-sight velocity, backscatter power, etc) and a particular scan are projected onto a polar format plot in [AACGMv2](http://superdarn.thayer.dartmouth.edu/aacgm.html) coordinates.

Currently, fan plots in pyDARN get the geographic positions of a radar's range gates by reading in pre-generated files (found in the `/pydarn/radar_fov_files` folder), and then [converts](https://pypi.org/project/aacgmv2/) them to AACGMv2 coordinates. In the future, pyDARN will generate the geographical position, which will bring support for not standard range/beam layouts.
The mapping of the range gate corners was based on [rbpos in RST](https://github.com/SuperDARN/rst/blob/0aa1fffed4cc48c1eb6372dfc9effa688af95624/codebase/superdarn/src.idl/lib/legacy.1.6/rbposlib.pro).

### Basic usage
pyDARN and pyplot need to be imported, as well as any FITACF file needs to be [read in](https://pydarn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/SDarnRead/):

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pydarn

#Read in fitACF file using SuperDARDRead, then read_fitacf
file = "path/to/fitacf/file"
SDarn_read = pydarn.SuperDARNRead(file)
fitacf_data = SDarn_read.read_fitacf()

```
With the FITACF data loaded as a list of dictionaries (`fitacf_data` variable in above example), you may now call the `plot_fan` method. Make sure you tell it which scan (numbered from first recorded scan in file, counting from 1 or give it a `datetime` object for the scan at that time) you want using `scan_index`:
```python
fanplot = pydarn.Fan.plot_fan(fitacf_data, scan_index=27, 
                              colorbar_label='Velocity [m/s]')
plt.show()
```
In this example, the 27th scan was plotted with the defaulted parameter being line-of-sight velocity:

You can also provide a `datetime` object to obtain a scan at a specific time: 
```python
pydarn.Fan.plot_fan(cly_data, scan_index=datetime(2015, 3, 8, 15, 26),
                     colorbar_label='Velocity [m/s]')
```

!!! Warning
    Do not include seconds, typically scans are 1 minute long so seconds may end in a error with no data. 

Default plots also do not show groundscatter as grey. Set it to true to colour groundscatter this way:
```python
fanplot = pydarn.Fan.plot_fan(fitacf_data, scan_index=27, groundscatter=1)
plt.show()

```

You might have noticed that the variable `fanplot` in the examples above actually holds some information. This contains the AACGM latitude and longitude of the fan just plotted, as well as the data, ground scatter information, and datetime object. If you instead change `fanplot` to 5 separate variables, it will return the latitude, longitude, data, groundscatter and datetime info into seperate variables:
```python
lats,lons,data,grndsct,datetime=pydarn.Fan.plot_fan(fitacf_data, scan_index=27)

lats.shape

```
Which returns `>>>(76, 17)`, i.e. ranges x beams array of the latitude, and so on for the other variables. The groundscatter array is 0's and 1's, 1 being a range gate flagged as groundscatter.

### Additional parameters

In addition to line-of-sight velocity, you can choose one of three other data products to plot by setting `parameter=String name`:

| Data product                          | String name |
|---------------------------------------|-------------|
| Line of sight velocity (m/s) [Default]| 'v'         |
| Spectral width (m/s)                  | 'w_l'       |
| Elevation angle (degrees)             | 'elv'       |
| Power (dB)                            | 'p_l'       |

!!! Note
    For some control programs, the user may need to specify a channel integer as `'all'` will not correctly show the data.
    In other cases, the user may want to specify the channel and use an integer (N) for the `scan_index`. Be aware that this will show the
    data for the Nth scan of only the chosen channel, not that of the entire file. 

`plot_fan` can concatenate with other plots including itself, here is an example of plotting two different radars with some of the above parameters:

```python
import pydarn
from datetime import datetime
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 

cly_file = 'data/20150308.1400.03.cly.fitacf'
pyk_file = 'data/20150308.1401.00.pyk.fitacf'

pyk_data = pydarn.SuperDARNRead().read_dmap(pyk_file)
cly_data = pydarn.SuperDARNRead().read_dmap(cly_file)

pydarn.Fan.plot_fan(cly_data, scan_index=datetime(2015, 3, 8, 14, 4),
                    colorbar=False, fov_color='grey', line_color='blue',
                    radar_label=True)

pydarn.Fan.plot_fan(pyk_data, scan_index=datetime(2015, 3, 8, 14, 4), 
                    colorbar_label='Velocity [m/s]', fov_color='grey',
                    line_color='red', radar_label=True)

#pydarn.Fan.plot_fov(66, datetime(2015, 3, 8, 15, 0), radar_label=True)
plt.show()
```
