# Reading in DMap structured SuperDARN data files
---

Data Map (DMap) is a binary self-describing format that was developed by Rob Barnes. 
This format is currently the primary format used by SuperDARN. 
For more information on DMap please see [RST Documentation](https://radar-software-toolkit-rst.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Types of files used by SuperDARN which are usually accessed in DMap format are:
- IQDAT
- RAWACF
- FITACF
- GRID/GRD
- MAP

This tutorial will focus on reading in DMap structured files using Pydarn, including how to read compressed files and access common data fields.

## Reading in files

The basic code to read in a DMap structured file is as follows:
```python
import pydarn

file = "path/to/file"
data = pydarn.read_dmap(file)
```
which puts the file contents into a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary containing one DMap record.
The function `read_dmap()` is able to read any DMap file type, but will not check to ensure that all fields for a given
DMap file type are there. There are specific I/O functions that will conduct these checks:
```python
iqdat_data = pydarn.read_iqdat(iqdat_file)
rawacf_data = pydarn.read_rawacf(rawacf_file)
fitacf_data = pydarn.read_fitacf(fitacf_file)
grid_data = pydarn.read_grid(grid_file)
map_data = pydarn.read_map(map_file)
snd_data = pydarn.read_snd(snd_file)
```
Note that if you pass a file of the incorrect type into one of these functions, it will raise an exception.
Another thing to note is that whether you read a file in using `read_dmap()` or one of the specific functions
like `read_rawacf()`, you will get the same data either way.

## Reading a compressed file

pyDARN can seamlessly read a compressed file like **bz2** (commonly used for SuperDARN data products). 
The I/O functions in the section above will detect `.bz2` compression from the file extension, and handle
decompression automatically. 
```python
import pydarn
fitacf_file = "path/to/file.bz2"
records = pydarn.read_fitacf(fitacf_file)
```

## Accessing data fields
To see the names of the variables you've loaded in and now have access to, try using the `keys()` method:
```python
print(fitacf_data[0].keys())
```
which will tell you all the variables in the first [0th] record.

Let's say you loaded in a MAP file, and wanted to grab the cross polar-cap potentials for each record:
```python
file = "20150302.n.map"
map_data = pydarn.read_map(file)

cpcps=[i['pot.drop'] for i in map_data]
```
## Converting Borealis Files
Borealis data is often kept in RAWACF or BFIQ data formats. To be able to plot this data they must be converted into a SuperDARN data format.
In pyDARN, you can use the following example code to convert:

```python
import pydarn

borealis_file = "path/to/file"
sdarn_data = pydarn.read_borealis(borealis_file)
```
You can then use the dictionary of data in sdarn_data for your plotting needs.  
In addition, you can select a specific *slice* to convert by assigning `slice_id = 0` in the options. This option is required for files produced before Borealis v0.5 was released.

!!! Warning 
    There may be some issues with using `hdf5` libraries on a Windows machine. pyDARNio will be looking into this bug. 

## Other Examples

Other examples of using pyDARN with file reading is for reading in multiple 2-hour files, sorting them, and concatenating the data together.
For example, you may do something like this, using the **glob** library:

```python
import pydarn 
from glob import glob

fitacf_files = glob('path/to/fitacf/files/<date><radar>.fitacf.bz2')
data = list()

# assuming they are named via date and time
fitacf_files.sort()
print("Reading in fitacf files")
for fitacf_file in fitacf_files:
    records = pydarn.read_fitacf(fitacf_file)
    data += records
print("Reading complete...")
``` 

!!! Note 
    If you have any other reading or writing data requirements, please see the io package [pyDARNio](https://pydarnio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
