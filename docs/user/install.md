[![Python 3.6](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/) 
![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/superdarn/pydarn)
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3727269.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3727269)


!!! Important 
    It is recommended to install pyDARN via `pip`; however, please cite via the [DOI for the release](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3727269) 


## Prerequisites

pyDARN requires **python 3.6** or later and **matplotlib 3.3.4** or later.

Depending on your operating system or distribution, the following package installers, development environments or data parsers are required: 
 
| Ubuntu      | OpenSuse       | Fedora        | OSX           | Windows       |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| libyaml-dev | python3-PyYAML | libyaml-devel | Xcode/pip     | pip           |

You can check your python version using

`$ python --version` or 
`$ python3 --version`

!!! Note
    If you have already installed `pydarn` you can use `pip3 install --upgrade pydarn`

## Dependencies

pyDARN's setup will download the following dependencies: 

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (For developers)
- [pip3](https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000699011-Using-pip3-to-install-Python3-modules)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib 3.3.4+](https://matplotlib.org/) 
- [PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation)
- [pyDARNio](https://pydarnio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/install/)
- [AACGMv2](https://pypi.org/project/aacgmv2/) 

!!! Note
    If you wish to plot coastlines you will need to install cartopy>=0.19 separately

### Cartopy 
[Cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/) is a Python package designed for geospatial data processing in order to produce maps and other geospatial data analyses. This library is used when invoking a projection system needing overlapped coastline maps in Fan, Grid and Map plots. 

For installing cartopy please follow the packages [installation](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/installing.html) instructions. For ubuntu here is good installation [link](https://techoverflow.net/2021/07/11/how-to-install-cartopy-on-ubuntu/) 

!!! Warning
    For cartopy to work with pyDARN please make sure it version `>=0.19`. Otherwise pydarn will throw an exception if you try to use it.  


!!! Note
    cartopy is a challenging package to install so please provide any information on troubleshoot or solutions to common issue on [pyDARN github](https://github.com/SuperDARN/pydarn) page. 



## Virtual Environments
It is recommended to install pyDARN in one of the suggested virtual environments if you have multiple python/pip 3 version on your computer, or do not want to affect the main system's python libraries. 

The following virtual environments have been tested by pyDARN developers:"

### pip Virtual Environment
Instructions can be found here [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

Option 1:
1. `$ python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv` (Install virtual environment package)
2. `$ python3 -m virtualenv <environment name>`  (Make your virtual environment)
3. `$ source <environment name>/bin/activate`  (Activate the virtual environment)
4. `$ pip install pydarn`    (Install pyDARN)

!!! Note
    If you have multiple versions of python 3 on your machine, you can access a specific version by: `python<version number>`. 
    For example, if you want to install python 3.6 virtual environment: `python3.6 -m pip install --user virtualenv`.

### Anaconda Virtual Environment
Instructions can be found here [conda environment](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/) and installing [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

1. `$ conda create -n yourenvname python=3.7 anaconda`
2. `$ conda activate yourenvname`
* `$ pip install pydarn`

#### Adding the environment to PyCharm

To set the project interpreter to the anaconda environment:

1. File -> Settings -> Project Folder -> Project Interpreter
2. Click the project Interpreter drop down list and click on show all.
* If you don't see the environment you wish to use click the plus sign on the right side bar named "Add"
* Select "Conda Environment" on the left side menu.
* Click "Existing Environment" and give the interpreter field the path to your environment's python.exe and apply.

## Local Install
**pip3 install**

`pip3 install --user pydarn`

## System Install 
`sudo pip3 install pydarn`

## Installing for Development

pyDARN's default github branch is `develop` for quicker and easer development. 

It is encouraged to use [SSH keys in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) 

`git clone git@github.com:SuperDARN/pydarn.git`

To install: 

`$ pip3 install . --user`

!!! Note
    If `pip --version` is pointing to python 3.6+ then you can use `pip install . --user` instead. 

!!! Note
    Sometimes `python setup.py install` is needed to grab all hardware files (known issue).

Please read pyDARN [Workflow documentation](../dev/team.md) to further understand how to develop in pyDARN.
    
## Troubleshooting

### Pip3 installation with Ubuntu 20.4/python 3.8.4

Issue: `pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/superdarn/pydarn@develop` not working

Solution:
1. check git is installed `apt install git` (for ubuntu)
2. Check pip version `pip --version` - with newer distros of Linux/Virtual machines `pip` may point to pyhon3 and you will not need pip3. 
3. Alternative virtual environment steps for getting python 3.8 working

```bash 
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3-virtualenv python3-pip
$ cd ~/
$ mkdir venvs
$ virtualenv -p python3.8 ~/venvs/py38
$ echo "source $HOME/venvs/py38/bin/activate" >> ~/.bashrc
```
Then open a new terminal and you should see `(pyy38)` in the prompt.

### aacgmv2 won't install 

Issue: `unable to execute 'gcc': No such file or directory
    error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1`

Solution: 
  1. Ensure `gcc` is installed if not install it
  2. Ensure you install `python3-dev` (Ubuntu) or `python3-devel` for RPM OS Linux operating systems.

### Summary plots get a ValueError 

Issue: `ValueError: Cannot convert 0 to a date.  This often happens if non-datetime values are passed to an axis that expects datetime objects.` when using `plot_summary`

Solution:
1. check matplotlib version, if lower than 3.3.4 then upgrade matplotlib equal or higher version.  
2. `pip install -U matplotlib`
