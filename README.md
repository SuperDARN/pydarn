## Documentation

pyDARN's documentation can found [here](https://pydarn.readthedocs.io/en/latest)

## Getting Started

To install and use pyDARN please read the [installation guide](https://pydarn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/install/).

If wish to get access to SuperDARN data please read the [SuperDARN data access documentation](https://pydarn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/superdarn_data/).
Please make sure to also read the documentation on [**citing superDARN and pydarn**](https://pydarn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/citing/). 

As a quick tutorial on using pydarn to read a compressed file: 
``` python
import bz2
import pydarn 

# read in compressed file
fitacf_file = '20180220.C0.rkn.stream.fitacf.bz2'
with bz2.open(fitacf_file) as fp: 
      fitacf_stream = fp.read()

reader = pydarn.SDarnRead(fitacf_stream, True)
records = reader.read_fitacf()
```

For more information and tutorials on pyDARN please see the [tutorial section](https://pydarn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
